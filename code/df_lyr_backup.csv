All right I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin' on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her 'cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
'Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin' about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should have done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin' hold grudges well oh fudge
It's a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin' shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin' to front on me ya know
That's exactly how I'm goin' to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
'Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin' me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin'
Actin' like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and that's weak shit
That's why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to"

But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch

And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide 
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

I'll work myself to death for you
Just to show I adore you
Nothing I wouldn't do for you

'Cause my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide 
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

All I ever, ever hope to be
Depends on your love for me
Baby, believe me
If you should leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell
I know darn well, I can tell, now

I don't know much
But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch

And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied

Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something"

I can sink or swim but either way I'm a goner
Piranhas in the ocean and the sky and in my bed
Piranhas keep on biting till they get inside my head

And everyone wants to take a little bite
Till they're suckin' on my bones, they're scrapin' at my life
I can sink or swim but either way I'm a goner
I'm on a sinking ship and surrounded by piranha
And we drop down, just a little more down

I see them all around - just a-waitin' and a-watchin'
I see it in their eyes as the floor keeps droppin'
I ain't gonna win but I won't go without a fight
Alone on a ship in a race against time
And it's runnin' out"

Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying

Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord
When the sun goes down

Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die

Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying

Well there's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
Well there's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed

I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die

Body free and a body less, ya
Come again just to start a-fresh and
Once again to find a home

In the moment of the meantime

Dropping in, coming through the mesh, ya
Checking in just to get it blessed, ya
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
Find a form that's free to roam

Do it all then it all again, ya
Make it up and you make a friend, ya
Paddle on, just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see

All the mamas and the papas

Take a chance on a 'recommend', ya
Hard as hell just to comprehend, ya

Easy now to find a breeze

They are twisting
And my mouth is dry
Like cool air inside

Maybe I worry
Do things in a hurry
And follow the dust
Of people like new

There's people like me
And people like you

Yeah, the roads are right tonight
They are turning
And I know that deep inside the pines
An answer is lurking

And maybe I worry
Do things in a hurry
And follow the dust

It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
Oh I wanna' die
It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day no matter what you say
You find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find out that I'm in love with you

Aiyyo Tha Alkies set the trends that the whole world follow
Fuck a CD, fuck a tape, we should sell this shit in bottles
(Are you a role model?) Not, CaTash'll steal yo' beatbox
I drink cuss and smoke and sock niggaz with cheap shots
The gunner - Wonderman, Wonderwoman husband
The stunner - fuck with us y'all niggaz must be buzzin
I love it; we coulda been washed like dirty dishes
But the Genie in the Lamp gave Tash like 30 wishes
First I wished for health 'cause I be thinkin' bout myself
I be drinkin' by myself, livin' shrinkin like an elf
Next I wished for wealth, 90 million in the bank account
Young niggaz with money, that's somethin' we need to think about
'Cause we could be the President, we could be the Senators
Right now niggaz think we just drug dealers and janitors
We big, that's big, we large, in charge
I told the Genie next I want a car like the stars
A Bentley, a Coupe, a truck with the OOP
With the three level seats for when it's time to scoop my group
I thirst, for loops, I told the Genie next
I want the King Tee albums plus Xzibit on cassette
Next, I told the Genie like it or not
Last wish I hope you die 'cause I want yo' spot
Tash come from rock bottom want funk beats we got 'em
I can bust my shit in spring you won't catch it till next autumn
We taught them niggaz how to rhyme this hot
We drink a lot, smoke a lot, da-da da-da, da-da da-da

Babylon and chron' - six foes on the line
Smashin down Avalon like a ghetto amazon
Brown-bagger; take it to the head like Marvin Hagler
Livin' underground like a badger
Wall to wall like a tagger - original pants sagger
Bite my rhymes and your whole grill might shatter
Remi and Hennesey, fuckin' up my bladder
If your girl say she know me then I probably got at her
Sometimes I'm hard to find like downtown parkin spaces
I'ma be old and grey and still flirtatious
Remove my shoes for foot races, primitive man ate fish
But MC's are the latest on my dish mentally spacious
You didn't create this so you, naturally hate this
Wait Miss, do you like what you see? How do you rate this?
Relax I'm not a rapist just, one of the greatest
Born winner hair full of basses opposite of weightless
Mastered the art of holdin' bottles double-fisted
X.O Hennesey fifth, unassisted
We not promotin drinkin', we just havin' some fun
Fuck it, we drink in Appleton and Nantucket
Mashin down Van Nuys, puffin stress in the bucket
Ghetto hip-hop for the public, you love it
At Lovitz, you love the Alkaholik wino
Pissin off the strippers up in the spearmint rhinos

(Group laughter)
You like that? A like da da-da

(E-Swift)
Okay, here we go, original, liquor sto' flow
Ghetto non-mellow pissy drunk alkapella yo'
Average, everyday around the hood fellows
Though we always bring the ruckus we some wild motherfuckers
Niggaz call me CPR - I help rap music breathe
With beats and rhymes you wouldn't believe
What I did is that you couldn't conceive
With a ho on each sleeve with a crew of niggaz rollin' on D's
It's them Alkaholik niggaz flowin with the toilet niggaz
Party-crashin raid-thrashin beer-smashin brolic niggaz
Peers drinkin' irrational thinkin' don't give a fuck about nuttin
Blame it on the alcohol consumption
Yeah we overdid it, I had to admit it
It's Tha Likwid, we underground rap music's prime ticket
Sick wid it, E-Swift be quick with it
Everytime I spit it forget it, y'all need to quit it

C'mon, yeah you heard the man
I just do what the doers do

Now I been makin' hits since underage
Contract intact, can't be under paid
This ain't a game I ain't fun to play
Don't front for me I ain't from the A
Don't you wanna hear what I come to say
This just a kid you know me from before
Prices go up when I come in the store
I'm in another island in a bungalow
Evisu down to my underclose
Ate like a cat that was undersold
I give and get it back in a hundred fo'
I feel like a man that was from the road
And y'all know that I will bring you out
And what I'm talkin' you don't know a thing about
Bring Modenas out
Take a scenic route
Bettin against me, it's bound to clean you out

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop-top cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia

It's hard to get low
In a 3-6-0 Spider
License plates all the chicks know
Cats walk around buffed up like beach guys
But they don't put no fear in these eyes
Besides, I'm just here to teach lives
Girl walk around, try to give me the slide
The ice on my arm it gave me all away
I roll up the tint top up and rode away
I smell like money, let the odor stay
Go in my closet, fur to throw away
I'm never lost I already know the way
If I need it for tonight I'll get it for today
I'm God-made, I took five years parlay
Home pool, arcade and it's all paid
What say, I spend a third on a upgrade
Import palm trees 'cause I ain't have enough shade

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop-top cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia

And when the record plays
What will the haters say
Oh don't you be afraid 'cause I'm your alliby
So when I'm drivin' by
Don't try to analyse
And beacause of him I'ma still be fly
And this our lullaby

C'mon now, you know my flow
I'm in and out
Non guilty, I ain't gotta buy the trout
Couple of critics but I ain't gon' stop now
I got a plane to catch to be in Moscow
I'm on jets, they doin' sky miles
So I see why the people so hostile
It's no drama, it's mo' honor
I'm wanted in the world like I was Osama
This is no exageration
Why these people so mad at Mason

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop-top cars and SUVs
G5 flights and shopping sprees
This is where you wanna be
This is La Familia

In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered and when radio was king
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair"

Spaceboy

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free

Don't you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days

But moondust will cover you
Cover you

This chaos is killing me
Space fucking boy

Spaceboy, fuck you
Space fucking boy

Bye bye love
Bye bye fucking spaceboy
Bye bye love
Fuck up Spaceboy!

Bye bye my love"

Promises broken
At quarter past five
Burning fires
On the railway hillsides

But today I got her letter said she'd be my cajun bride
Gonna go and wed my cajun baby and I've by the old bayou
Eat a lotsa shrimp and crawfish ride around in my old pirogue

Before the sun goes down this evening I'll be on my way

No sesame street kids, watch BET, look up to niggas that ain't got a G.E.D, I know a dude with the deadbeat tag, kids don't got diapers but hes riding in the red g wag.

91,TRBGUUE128F1494FB6.h5,David Bowie,Baal's Hymn,"Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes

And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
""Space enough"" said Baal, ""then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb""

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead

Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us"

Even though your mind is in trance.
Don't be mislead by vision,
'Cause it's more that just a decision.
It is a rule and a new way of living,
And it's the only chance that is given.

Nothing's wrong is dreaming,
About the way your life used to be.
But let me tell you life is beaming,
Just look around and you'll see,
Get with it and stick with the program,
Don't take the risk if you can.
I believe it's more than just a wave, and ...

Can we try, try to make a new life,
Let's start right now, don't jive.

I'm gonna be number one in proving,
That I think before I start moving.
Let's get it right, don't hesitate,
Don't wait to long 'cause it's late.

It is guarantee, no maybe.
Bang! An explosion,
Can you feel the vibe and it's strong.
Bang! Bang! That's the notion,
Taking care of life can't be wrong.
Keep on loving, 'cause it's good,
And standing tall is brave.
I really hope that you understood, that...

Oh let it go through your body.
Oh let it go through your soul.
Oh if you wanna dance with somebody,
Yhere's one thing you should know.

Do you know,
What you can do if you want to?
Do you know,
Don't let your mind run free.
Do you know,
Better be safe than sorry.
Do you know,
That is the one for me."

But you turned away,
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?

And imagine myself living without you

Beyond the light to a dark world without end
The spirit escapes the temple of flesh
As seductive winds of madness
Absorbing me in to the cryogenic system

Enter a galactic domain
Frozen in time and space
A new infinity of serenity
Interstellar voyage
The spirit escapes the temple of flesh
Into the sphere of mystified gloom
A cosmic funeral of memories

A void of lifeless dreams

A mania to explore the enigma
Isolated celestial corpse
Astral embryonic life form
Invocation of the dormant realms

How far must we run before they do not recognise us?

And let's try not to complain about your smoking
And my distant heart, and my distant heart
And my distant heart

And every May 18, which is the flag day, the father came
Put the Haitian flag in front of the house

Slatka mala maloletnice
Prirodna srećnice 
Na torti si stigla 
Tek do šesn'este svećice 

Mala mamina pametnice
Imaš sve petice 
A pališ licem bebice 
Sa pogledom grešnice 
Koji gradom širi srčke 
I upale desnice 

Neki su spremni čak 
I da ukrste pesnice 
Hipnotisani, nesvesni 
Da ne hajes za bednike 

Fotografi modni drže 
Vanredne sednice 
U želji da te stave 
Na sve naslovne stranice 

Uzdah širi se leti 
Kada hodaš pored stanice 
Pogledi sevaju ko sa 
Kremena varnice 

Svi zaborave na dogovore
Natrpane satnice 
Zbog bronzanog tena
Tvog tela mlade ratnice 

Zbog anđeoskog lica
Zbog dve zvezde danice 
Zbog kose boje klasja 
Sa panonske oranice 

Veština majke prirode 
Sve premašila je granice 
Slatka mala maloletnice
Primi moje čestitke 

Sa svog pijedestala ti 
Inspirišeš pesnike 
Intelektualce i ulične grešnike 
Izjednačuješ u želji 

Da bar jednom kresnu te
Trule punaće i prosjake bez love 
Izjednačujes kad pohodiš
Im noću mokre snove 

Ali stvar je pod kontrolom 
Jer bojimo se Marice 
Kad roditelji tvoji budu 
Pokretali parnice
Slatke male maloletnice
Prirodne srećnice, male grešnice 

Sunce zalazi, vetar mazi 
A šef u potrazi 
Dan ko iz snova prolazi 
Ja sam u šetnje polazim 

Trazim nekog da podelim 
S njim jedan dim 
Il' neku curicu spremnu 
Da s njom delim tron 

Hodam ulicom, u vazduhu 
Se oseća tvoj vajb 
To je osećaj taj
Ljubavni pokret kao trajb 
I za kraj srećem 

Poznato lice devojčice 
Koja mi nije dopustila
Već je propustila 
Sa Don Huanom romansu 
Al' nije kasno, vidim šansu 

U njenom pogledu i glasu
Jer stigla je u pravom času
Na uvo joj šapućem
Osmeh predivan ko uvek 

Krasi lice boginje
Još uvek za tobom žudi ovaj čovek 
Pa da li ima nade 
Ove večeri mlade 

Za zvuk serenade 
Jer tvoj pogled mi nadu dade 
Zanemari sve jade
Sve probleme, sve dileme 

Daj mi ruku, krajnje je vreme 
Da dotaknem sve teme 
Kaže, možemo kod mene
Očima daje mi znak 

Ispuniću ti sve želje
Samo mi pusti Sindikat 
Sada jači nego ikad
Ja ljubim njen vrat 

Jezik ide sve niže 
Šef spreman za napad 
Tvoji nisu tu
Govor tela priča za nju 

Sa sebe skida odeću svu
Čekam te u kupatilu
Pod tužem izvajanu figuru 
Gledam vlažnu i golu 

Cela noć je pred nama 
A priča gubi kontrolu
Slatke male maloletnice 
Slatke male, slatke maloletnice 

A ja zgrožen 
Nad svim ovim, kratak biću 
Zato šajslu i tiću 
Dok budem pričo ovu priču

Uzo sam neku siću
Kreno ka kafiću
Da se nađem na piću
Sa Sindikalcima

Ali od tog momenta 
Ni sekunde dve nisu jos prosle 
Kada dve curice vidim da mi prilaze 
Kazu, Sindikalce, dugo smo te cekale 
Odmah pice donele i kraj mene su sele

Popile vopile i malo zadopile 
Dok se nisu opile ko prljavo kopile 
Onda krenule napolje, zovu me
Ajdemo u zezanje, bice jace u troje

Kazem, niste normalne
Vidi na sta licite 
Pijane ko guzice
Bljuju na sred ulice 

Al' da ne bude zabune 
Iako maloletnice 
Slatke ste ko breskvice
Prave male misice 

Sklon'te se, nemoj da me mamite 
Znate kol'ko robije moze da se dobije 
Sve zbog pedofilije ma bez'te od mene
Bez'te od mene, slatke maloletnice

Ti i ja pedofilija

Osamdeset drugo
Trece, cetvrto, peto, sesto 
Sve ih mesam vesto 
Ne pitam za mesto 

Dok ih gledam iz korole
Kako dolaze iz skole 
Vidim jednu malu mnogo slatku
Vozi role 

Bauer il' Roces, molim
Sta ti hoces na keksic da dodjes 
Da se zezamo nocas 
Znam te jos odavno 
S Nove Godine kod Galeta 

Da l' preko Vune, Bokija il' Saleta

Ako ne zuris kuci 
Ajde sa mnom do Bizara

Il' da palimo na kalis 
Ako kafic tebe smara 
Da blejimo bez para 

I setamo mog kera 
Cekam te u cetiri 
Posle podne oko skvera 
Nemoj da me ispalis 
I nepotrebno kasnis 

Zvacu te ne mobilni 
Posle skole kad se vratis 
Jos jednom da mi potvrdis 
Da ces uvek biti tu 
Na vreme pored mene 
Moja mala beti bu 

I nema vise puj pike 
Nista ne vazi 
Pogledaj me u oci
Iskreno mi kazi 

Da u jednom trenutku 
Tebi mogu biti ravan ili me ti gotivis 
Samo zato sto sam slavan 
Smesan, zabavan, ludi lik iz price

Da li jedna si od onih 
Sto se poznanstvom sa mnom dice 
Ili mozes da me volis 
Bas onakvog kakav jesam 

Da brines se o meni
Ziv sam, s kim sam, gde sam
S klinkama pre sam probao sve
Ali tebe kad sam upoznao 

Postao sam svestan
Da pedofilija radja pedofiliju 
Nemojte to probati kod kuce 
Maloletnice su ko cvet 
Nevine i nezne kao rosa na uranku 
Bice da su ko cvet 

Tvoje ljubavi strela 
Snazno cepa moja creva 
Osecam te jako 
Kao deo svoga tela 
I samo kad bi htela 

Sve sto htela je Venera 
Ja bio bi tvoj Zevs 
A ti bila moja Hera 
Jer Kupidon sto smera 
On to provereno izvrsi 

Posalje mi Amora 
Da strelama me izbusi 
Razum mi narusi
Tera me da lutam 
U oblacima magle 
Tada ja plutam"

And push myself right off
How could I hold myself liable
Under such madness, do pray tell
Faces of bottles read through the night
Swaying in context, warning light
Yet another patron is dedicated
To this last jam
It's only 40 seconds till the show begins
Watch the screaming squabble of drunken state
Son, another grayscale of apathy in such a place
Not much time for reaction if one is wake
For fear of contracting such vile taste
This has been the last time
He'll leave here almost deadly undone
Pre-empt of fear
10 seconds now till the curtain is raised
Cold sweat seeps from his liquored brow
No one to throw the ring
One foot of water now
In panic stricken reigned he forgets how to swim
I'll scratch another from the cleansing post
It's almost a rush to reach for the blade
It goes from shame to shambles in less than days
Natural selection with a shove I'll take it from here."

Send a doctor to my house
Got me a fever coming round the bend
A heavy busload of danger

Straight talking you're sending me to bed
'Cause I ain't walking, in my state
A temperature that will not go away
So let it build up in my head

My head...

Prescribed pills just throw them down the sink
Cause in the hills is my cure.
No city headache to knock on my front door
No spewing faces to bug me.

Your output level brings thunder to my ears
A peaking signal from your mouth
Some cleansing water to wash away the grime of city laughter
Off my face.

My face...

It's not for me
The speed in which you walk
Would burn the soles of my feet.
Congested and choking from the fog
Of chain-smoking freak shows
That's how it goes so you just find the road
And pack your bags, for no more..."

Trente-six ans et toujours pas mariée
Mène sa vie de vieille jeune fille
Elle entretient sa p'tite routine.
Pas de copain, de chéri, jamais rien
Pour lui faire changer son quotidien
Un jour, à Josy, on lui a dit :
""Enfin, Josy, qu'est-ce que tu fais de ta vie?""
Alors elle s'est trouvée 
Un chien.

A Josy, qu'est ce qu'on y avait pas dit
Ce chien va lui exploser sa vie
Elle qui e faisait jamais la fête
Il la conduira droit à sa perte.
Mais ça elle ne le sait pas encore
Son chien pour l'instant elle l'adore
Un jour Josy elle nous a dit :
""Ah ben, vraiment, les gars, j'vous r'mercie
Ma vie sans lui, ah ça non 
D'un chien.""

Depuis, Josy s'défonce en quatre,
S'démène, court à gauche et puis à droite
Parfois même au boulot arrive en r'tard
Tout ça pour l'bonheur de son clébard.
Terminés, les principes et la routine
Josy, c'est dev'nu une vraie coquine
Un jour, on s'est dit allons voir Josy
Et là
Pour la r'connaître on a eu un mal 
De chien.

Voilà Josy sur son p'tit nuage
Avec son clebs, ils sont vraiment pas sage
Eh ! Josy, l'amour te donne des ailes
Mais là tu frises l'excès de zèle.
Du Sheeba à la zoophilie
Tout le reste souvent tu oublies
Un jour le patron a dit à Josy :
""Josy, tu files un mauvais coton""
C'était juste avant le sale temps 
De chien.

Josy a poussé l'bouchon trop loin
L'banquier, l'boss, l'huissier lui filent le train
Aïe aïe aïe, Josy, ça sent la fin
Et les impôts qui grimpent n'arrangent rien.
Happy end ou fatalité
On savait plus quoi trouver
Un jour, pour Josy, on a eu une idée :
""On arrête la chanson, et tu finis comme tu veux,
Tu choisis comment mener ta vie

Pervading every single nook of existence

Veidon anatlâ
Trireinos koilon monis pantos
Volevos kaion moricos
Ni têrsos tenkos sves nâus-anatia
In litaviâ votno-ûrâ
Mê anatlô

Qe tebô lama deivos skver-ollos
Qe tebô lama deivos mê anatlô

Laden with the burdens of this life
The barque sails through endless waters
Deep and dark

Yet gestated pristinely and free
Escorting to the biding warmth
Of the womb

""I am a bard do not vouchsafe my secrets to slaves
I am a guide a judge if you sow you will labour"""

Then go back to it another day.
The green mind said it's okay...
Cause you know where they're gonna be.
All's you have to do is come with me.
It's cool, they're probably asleep.

On the outside,
That's where they always hide.
Come to my side
And I'll introduce you to...
Some of their kind.
I know you've always tried.
And now it's your time to take in their point of view,
Though it's nothing new.

I been bouncin' off the wall,
I can't handle them for long.
They're cool, but I need you...
On a certain level I think they're great,
But on another I can't relate...
To anything they do.

On the outside,
Might be with them tonight.
Unless you decide to come n' I'll check out you.
Hangin' heavy such a routine,
I've just begun to forget
Why I seldom try to break out of their scene.
And now I gotta work on you,
So the frogs will hang and they'll always be hangin'...
Now we're here, what do we do?

I've been sortin' through the pros,
And cons of your eyes, farewell toads.
Can't you help move it along?
I been pickin' through my thoughts,
It's a shame my judgement rots...
And I sure feel rotten long...

On the outside...
Well, it'll be a while.
I gotta unfry 'fore I pick it up with you.(Help me)
Do I need that stable care?
Don't I know that they'll be there?
Does that count now you've appeared?
Do I need that stable core?
Or do I jump for something more?
Are you all that I fear?

I been pickin' through my thoughts,
It's a shame my judgement rots...
And I sure feel rotten long...
It's a call that's tough to make.
It could be a big mistake.
Can't you help move it along?
If I keep stewin' 'bout how I feel,
Eventually you'll split,
Then I won't have to deal.(Sounds like a plan)
But it's kind of lame to let it slide,
Knowin' either way I haven't tried.
Can't figure out where it all stands...
In a green mind..."

Isn't it funny?

I found redemption in suffering

And it's just like you to say

Now I'm stumbling through my words
And it's all your fault
So feel guilty

Stained, lookin' for a way out of this mess
Feelings and the truth hard to confess
But you've seen the cycle round
Now I guess you have me figured out

So you watched me suffer
Inched its way slowly under my skin
But I saw this comin'
When you started runnin'
Now it seems sensible to burn the bridge

And it's just like you to say
That it's better when you have things your way
Now I'm stumbling through my words

But you're wrong
What we been missing is more than a touch
But the words seem so clear
Through the illusions that love will survive
These are words I hope you'll hear

If this is the end then why don't I wanna go
My feeling defends answers we ought to know
If this is the end must the story close this way
Why can't we pretend if this is the end?

Most say it's familiar, good things don't last
But one never forsees
The senseless conclusion that's coming to play
In our lives
Although it's apparent and perfectly clear
We both know what's in store
There's just no disguising the pain and the fear
Are we worth fighting for?

I don't know the solution, I don't know that answer is
To work it out
But we won't know the meaning if we fall past the ways

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone

Then John, he got up from the table, slowly he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife and little children back home
How his drinking had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off into that streetlight
And the vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him, lying drunk in that gutter
Clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read

Ihr wollt lieber intimere, mehr persönliche Texte 
die man abends beim Kuscheln hört, so auf gemütlich mit Kerze? 
Wollt sogar die Sachen hörn, die ich sonst keinem erzähle 
bis auf die tiefsten Abgründe meiner eigenen Seele? 
Habt gehört, daß ich Vater wär und verheiratet wäre, 
wollt den Stand der Dinge erfahrn sowie weitere Pläne ... 
Doch ratet mal was! Das ist nicht Inhalt meiner Verträge, 
ich wurd zum Dissen gesigned und tu's bis jeder in diesem Business weint. 
Mich krist du nicht klein mit deinen Fragen, wie ich wirklich bin, 
denn immer wenn ich euch Clou's geb, scheint es, ihr hört nicht hin. 
Mal unter uns: Auch ich hab Probleme wie du 
aber ich geb es nicht zu. Verdammt, ich leb nicht im Zoo! 
Ihr wollt doch nur Infos von mir, damit ihr mehr über mich reden könnt 
und die Komplexe vergeßt, mit denen ihr durch euer Leben rennt, 
in dem ihr alles verdrängt und die Zeit totschlagt, 
damit darüber zu meckern was ich am Mic so sag.

Ich tu was ich tun will, nie was ich tun soll, 
Rap mit dem Mund voll, während ich am Mic rumproll. 
Was ist denn los? Ihr kennt meinen Style doch - na also! 
Die ganze Welt dreht sich um mich: Ich bin ein Egoist wie Falco. 
Mir egal was ich nicht darf, schon als Kind war ich nie bra 
und was ihr als tiefsinnig seht, versetzt mich in Tiefschlaf. 
Ich weiß, ihr ganzen Leute liebt solche intimen Gesprächsthemen, 
doch ich wollte sowas mein Leben lang nur aus dem Weg gehen. 
Mit sowas könnt ihr mich jagen, und habt ihr noch Fragen? 
Dann könnt Ihr die von mir aus auch noch gerne weiterhin haben. 
Verdammt! Alle labern mich voll mit irgend sonnem Unsinn, 
daß andere ihre Emotionen so toll auf'n Punkt bringen. 
Achja , ich versteh'! Und jetzt bin ich der Dümmere, 
nur weil ich mich nicht ständig um so'n Pussy-Scheiß kümmere, 
nicht ganz so viel rumjammere wie andere 
und lieben Themen, die mich selber interessieren, behandele. 
Doch ihr meint, die hätten interessantere Themen. 
Kannste mal seh'n, dann kannst du ja auch zu den anderen geh'n. 
Mir ist egal, wer sich mit wem und was identifiziert, 
ich geh schon nicht mal mehr ran, wenn mein Scheiß-Handy vibriert.

Strophe 3 

""Ob er noch was anderes als Battlen kann?"" Tja, alle sind gespannt, 
finden meinen Style zwar interessant, 
aber ""es wär so schön, wenn du mal mehr Gefühle zeigt"", 
gern: Hier mehr Wut, mehr Haß, mehr Übelkeit. 
""Nein, ich meine: Kannst du nicht mal über was Nettes reden?"" 
Nein, Rap ist eben Competition, es wird immer Battles geben, 
Rapper, die andre Rapper dissen, Raper, die immer meckern müssen, 
Rapper, die tun als würden sie alles besser wissen. 
""Aber wieso wirst du denn nicht wenigstens Story-Teller?"" 
Nun ja, ich bau grad an 'ner Atombombe in meinem Hobby-Keller 
und hab daher keine Zeit zum Geschichten erzählen, 
ich muß den Scheiß berechnen, um mein Ziel nicht zu verfehlen. 
Jetzt mußt du gehen, doch bevor ich's in der Eile vergesse, 
gib mir mal aus reinem Interesse noch deine Adresse 
und ich schick dir was rum, was dir beweisen wird, wie genial ich bin 
und was dich und deine ganze Nachbarschaft zum Strahlen bringt.

Laßt eure Studenten-Rapper weiterhin Aufsätze schreiben,

Your deep voice and your smiling - the embrace I'll never get
You're sitting right in front of me - I feel your breath behind
When you've founded a destiny - You'll always be in my mind

Sebastian is my name for you
Sebastian, please don't cry
Sebastian I will always love you - I gave you wings - now fly

Look on to your future - I wanna let you go
You will find a better place - Without my pain and sorrow
I beg your pardon for my decision - Didn't ask you if you agree
Carry me within your heart - As the mother I could not be

Sebastian is my name for you
Sebastian, please don't cry
Sebastian I will always love you - I gave you wings - now fly
I gave you wings, now fly..."

And I froze in my bed
When I woke up I was divorced
How did you get back into my head
No no no no it was the radio
You're gone and I don't even think of you my little blue one

I was sleeping and had a dream
I was writing to you
It was creepy my dreamy dream
You read my letter remembered I loved you
No no no no you don't love me anymore
You're gone and I don't even think of you my little blue one

I don't even think of you reading your paper each morning
I don't even think of you sipping your coffee and yawning
I don't even think of your hands pulling hair back from off your pretty face
As I'm walking around this empty place

I remember and try to forget
With a bottle of wine
I remember and try to forget
That the ring you're not wearing is mine
No no no no you don't wear it anymore
You're gone and I don't even think of you my little blue one"
245,TRBIDUK128F42806A4.h5,Tampa Red,No Matter How She Done It,"I know a gal by the name of Mae Lou
She shook it so much she had the German flu

No matter how she done it,
No matter how she done it,
No matter how she done it,
She done it just the same

The women don't like her, they call her Ida Mae
But the way the men love her is a cryin' shame

I tell you people what she done
She made a hit with Jack the Ripper, and the only one

You women don't have to worry 'bout your life
She made Jack the Ripper throw away his knife

She shakes all over when she walks
She made a blind man see, and a dumb man talk

The copper brought her in, she didn't need no bail
She shook it for the judge, and put the cop in jail"

They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, 'cause
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- Its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&amp;R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yeah he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)"

Or just another white trash county kiss
'61, long brown hair and foolish eyes

He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
With drawbridges closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of a great divide

Out where the dreams all hide
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls died
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls died

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Ah, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide"

You think about droppin' your nuts, better pick them up
'Cause you and everybody wish that I'ma hit 'em up
So nigga give me mine, don't make me have ta take it
'Cause I put your family in a fucked up situation
Your mama like where my son at?

But the law, don't know where the gun at
So they can't touch me, can't question me
Can't fuck wit me - so it's an unsolved mystery
BGeezy a dawg yeah
Don't give a fuck about the law
Ready ta send you ta the morgue yeah
Have you feelin' like a number 2 pencil

Ya head and ya chest wodie
Catch ya dippin' by ya whole house when ya loaded
Give it too ya in blood, that's one way of solvin' problems my nigga
Come around my spot - don't know ya that's a problem my nigga

(Lil' Wayne)
All I know is bend swangin' - make the enemy block scorch

And now it's on and I'm ready for guerilla war

But waitin' front so when you come out they bust nigga
Trust nigga, this shorty wild
