 Baby, when I think about...
The day that we first met 
(The day that we first met)
Wasn't lookin' for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in bein' around you

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I dig the way that you get down 
(You get down, thugged out)
And you still know how to hold me 
(And you still know how to hold me)
Perfect blend, masculine 
(Can't get enough now)
I think I'm in love
Damn, finally

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special who makes this life worth living
I'm glad you're here, just lovin' me
So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came
I've been glad

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered and when radio was king
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs
And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair Waking up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in
It's all over me
I'm lying here in the dark
I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found
Remember when you said that you would change
Don't let me down
It's not fair how you are
I can't be complete, can you give me more?

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

Oh, please, you know what I need
Save all your lovin' for me
We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

Give you all of me
Give you everything
Give you all of me I saw a picture yesterday,
You know the one, we were laughing in the rain

Remember when you were still in love with me

But you turned away,
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?
'Cause I die inside every time I close my eyes
And imagine myself living without you

But you turned away
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me
Alone tonight

Come on make a move Backwards, forwards but making no ground at all
Standing in the city with the clocks counting one
And your face is still wet from the fight before
As your tears hit the ground, blue flowers spring from them
Baby, I'm ashamed of the things I put you through
Baby, I'm ashamed of the man I was for you

And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"
And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"

How fast must we run before we can just take off in flight?
How far must we run before they do not recognise us?
So let's take this from the start, you'll be me and I'll be you
And let's try not to complain about your smoking
And my distant heart, and my distant heart
And my distant heart

And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"
And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"

(Too many mirrors in this house)
(And I don't like to see myself like this)
(I'm becoming the man I used to be, I guess)
(These walls could tell you a thing or two)
(Things that you really don't want to know)
(Lend me your eyes for your point of view)
(Lend me your feet and I'll stand by you)

And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"
And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do" I was a mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix, except daddy get your gun
I'm missing my baby,
Still missing my baby

I was a stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady,
Maybe luck is a lady

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me,
I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said darling, kiss as many as you want
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken,
I though that loving you was out of the question
(Loving you was out of the question)
Then I saw my reflection (reflection)
Saying please don't let this go

Tell me,
I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour'd come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

(Celebrate the love of the one you're with) x18

Celebrate this life with you baby
I'd think you should celebrate, yeah
Don't put your love in chains, babe
Now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought I would see love
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

(I said celebrate the love of the one your're with)
Celebrate!
Celebrate!
As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up, baby
Now I walk in the midday sun City headache subsides your dreary tone
Send a doctor to my house
Got me a fever coming round the bend
A heavy busload of danger

Straight talking you're sending me to bed
'Cause I ain't walking, in my state
A temperature that will not go away
So let it build up in my head

My head...

Prescribed pills just throw them down the sink
Cause in the hills is my cure.
No city headache to knock on my front door
No spewing faces to bug me.

Your output level brings thunder to my ears
A peaking signal from your mouth
Some cleansing water to wash away the grime of city laughter
Off my face.

My face...

It's not for me
The speed in which you walk
Would burn the soles of my feet.
Congested and choking from the fog
Of chain-smoking freak shows
That's how it goes so you just find the road
And pack your bags, for no more... Kid A, Kid A
Kid A, Kid A

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything All...that I did was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face 
And I sat up straight

Oh, yeah yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

(I'm so unwanted)
No
I just don't understand why                      
You won't talk to me
It hurts
That I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me

I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away

I tried to belong
It didn't seem wrong
My head aches
It's been so long
I'll write this song
If that's what it takes 
Yeah

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You'd just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You'd just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away
Make me go away You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid, turned it blue

Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing and it's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

You're given a flower
But I guess that there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think that it's just me teasing you

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid, turned it blue

Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid, turned it blue Johnny Walker sat at a table at the bar, minding his own affairs
Drinking his namesake over rocks, drunk, too drunk to care
When a girl in the bar walked up beside, and this is what she said
She said a woman came by with a letter for you and this is what the letter said

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read

Then John, he got up from the table, slowly he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife and little children back home
How his drinking had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off into that streetlight
And the vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him, lying drunk in that gutter
Clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read Hold on,
Hold out.
Your day's full.
Okay,
That's fine.
I don't mind
The meantime.
You've got your things to do,
Places you
Have to go,
So-and-so.
I don't mind the meantime.
I've been thinking I could count
From then till now.
I count too high.
I can't help but think about the meantime.
Saving time,
Spending it poorly.
I've been pretty full of shit the meantime.
If what comes next is
So damn precious,
Why should I mind
What you're doing
Meanwhile?
Lately I've been
Lost in thought
Around the clock.
Hands are flying and
I can tell you're running out of meantime. (oh, meantime)
Oh, now I know it's over too quick.
Got my finger on
Where it's all gone.
Don't look back 'cause I won't be there.
I don't have any more to spare and
It's all mine!
Meantime. Meantime. Meantime. A dustland fairytale beginning
Or just another white trash county kiss
'61, long brown hair and foolish eyes

He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
With drawbridges closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of a great divide

Out where the dreams all hide
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls died
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls died

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Ah, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide
