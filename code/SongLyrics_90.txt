 I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
Why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)
And everyday I fall (everyday...)
It makes me wonder why (everyday...)
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'Cause every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

(Repeat...) I picture things a certain way.
Then go back to it another day.
The green mind said it's okay...
Cause you know where they're gonna be.
All's you have to do is come with me.
It's cool, they're probably asleep.

On the outside,
That's where they always hide.
Come to my side
And I'll introduce you to...
Some of their kind.
I know you've always tried.
And now it's your time to take in their point of view,
Though it's nothing new.

I been bouncin' off the wall,
I can't handle them for long.
They're cool, but I need you...
On a certain level I think they're great,
But on another I can't relate...
To anything they do.

On the outside,
Might be with them tonight.
Unless you decide to come n' I'll check out you.
Hangin' heavy such a routine,
I've just begun to forget
Why I seldom try to break out of their scene.
And now I gotta work on you,
So the frogs will hang and they'll always be hangin'...
Now we're here, what do we do?

I've been sortin' through the pros,
And cons of your eyes, farewell toads.
Can't you help move it along?
I been pickin' through my thoughts,
It's a shame my judgement rots...
And I sure feel rotten long...

On the outside...
Well, it'll be a while.
I gotta unfry 'fore I pick it up with you.(Help me)
Do I need that stable care?
Don't I know that they'll be there?
Does that count now you've appeared?
Do I need that stable core?
Or do I jump for something more?
Are you all that I fear?

I been pickin' through my thoughts,
It's a shame my judgement rots...
And I sure feel rotten long...
It's a call that's tough to make.
It could be a big mistake.
Can't you help move it along?
If I keep stewin' 'bout how I feel,
Eventually you'll split,
Then I won't have to deal.(Sounds like a plan)
But it's kind of lame to let it slide,
Knowin' either way I haven't tried.
Can't figure out where it all stands...
In a green mind...
