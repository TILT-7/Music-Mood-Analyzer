The day that we first met

Wasn't lookin' for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in bein' around you

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I dig the way that you get down 
(You get down, thugged out)
And you still know how to hold me

I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special who makes this life worth living
I'm glad you're here, just lovin' me
So say that you won't leave

I've been glad

In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered and when radio was king
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs
And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair",2006,1

And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
Why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)

It makes me wonder why (everyday...)

You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

Too broke to fix, except daddy get your gun

Still missing my baby

I was a stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady,
Maybe luck is a lady

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me,
I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said darling, kiss as many as you want
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken,
I though that loving you was out of the question

Then I saw my reflection (reflection)

'Cause I ain't walking, in my state
A temperature that will not go away
So let it build up in my head

Prescribed pills just throw them down the sink
Cause in the hills is my cure.
No city headache to knock on my front door
No spewing faces to bug me.

Your output level brings thunder to my ears
A peaking signal from your mouth
Some cleansing water to wash away the grime of city laughter
Off my face.

My face...

It's not for me

Would burn the soles of my feet.

Of chain-smoking freak shows
