 Baby, when I think about...
The day that we first met 
(The day that we first met)
Wasn't lookin' for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in bein' around you

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I dig the way that you get down 
(You get down, thugged out)
And you still know how to hold me 
(And you still know how to hold me)
Perfect blend, masculine 
(Can't get enough now)
I think I'm in love
Damn, finally

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special who makes this life worth living
I'm glad you're here, just lovin' me
So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came
I've been glad

I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered and when radio was king
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs
And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair I saw a picture yesterday,
You know the one, we were laughing in the rain
Remember how it used to be,
Remember when you were still in love with me

But you turned away,
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?
'Cause I die inside every time I close my eyes
And imagine myself living without you

But you turned away
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me
Alone tonight
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move I was a mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix, except daddy get your gun
I'm missing my baby,
Still missing my baby

I was a stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady,
Maybe luck is a lady

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me,
I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said darling, kiss as many as you want
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken,
I though that loving you was out of the question
(Loving you was out of the question)
Then I saw my reflection (reflection)
Saying please don't let this go

Tell me,
I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour'd come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

(Celebrate the love of the one you're with) x18

Celebrate this life with you baby
I'd think you should celebrate, yeah
Don't put your love in chains, babe
Now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought I would see love
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

(I said celebrate the love of the one your're with)
Celebrate!
Celebrate!
As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up, baby
Now I walk in the midday sun I picture things a certain way.
Then go back to it another day.
The green mind said it's okay...
Cause you know where they're gonna be.
All's you have to do is come with me.
It's cool, they're probably asleep.

On the outside,
That's where they always hide.
Come to my side
And I'll introduce you to...
Some of their kind.
I know you've always tried.
And now it's your time to take in their point of view,
Though it's nothing new.

I been bouncin' off the wall,
I can't handle them for long.
They're cool, but I need you...
On a certain level I think they're great,
But on another I can't relate...
To anything they do.

On the outside,
Might be with them tonight.
Unless you decide to come n' I'll check out you.
Hangin' heavy such a routine,
I've just begun to forget
Why I seldom try to break out of their scene.
And now I gotta work on you,
So the frogs will hang and they'll always be hangin'...
Now we're here, what do we do?

I've been sortin' through the pros,
And cons of your eyes, farewell toads.
Can't you help move it along?
I been pickin' through my thoughts,
It's a shame my judgement rots...
And I sure feel rotten long...

On the outside...
Well, it'll be a while.
I gotta unfry 'fore I pick it up with you.(Help me)
Do I need that stable care?
Don't I know that they'll be there?
Does that count now you've appeared?
Do I need that stable core?
Or do I jump for something more?
Are you all that I fear?

I been pickin' through my thoughts,
It's a shame my judgement rots...
And I sure feel rotten long...
It's a call that's tough to make.
It could be a big mistake.
Can't you help move it along?
If I keep stewin' 'bout how I feel,
Eventually you'll split,
Then I won't have to deal.(Sounds like a plan)
But it's kind of lame to let it slide,
Knowin' either way I haven't tried.
Can't figure out where it all stands...
In a green mind... Hold on,
Hold out.
Your day's full.
Okay,
That's fine.
I don't mind
The meantime.
You've got your things to do,
Places you
Have to go,
So-and-so.
I don't mind the meantime.
I've been thinking I could count
From then till now.
I count too high.
I can't help but think about the meantime.
Saving time,
Spending it poorly.
I've been pretty full of shit the meantime.
If what comes next is
So damn precious,
Why should I mind
What you're doing
Meanwhile?
Lately I've been
Lost in thought
Around the clock.
Hands are flying and
I can tell you're running out of meantime. (oh, meantime)
Oh, now I know it's over too quick.
Got my finger on
Where it's all gone.
Don't look back 'cause I won't be there.
I don't have any more to spare and
It's all mine!
Meantime. Meantime. Meantime. A dustland fairytale beginning
Or just another white trash county kiss
'61, long brown hair and foolish eyes

He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
With drawbridges closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of a great divide

Out where the dreams all hide
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls died
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls died

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Ah, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide
