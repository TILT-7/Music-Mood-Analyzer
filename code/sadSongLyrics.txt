 Waking up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in
It's all over me
I'm lying here in the dark
I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found
Remember when you said that you would change
Don't let me down
It's not fair how you are
I can't be complete, can you give me more?

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

Oh, please, you know what I need
Save all your lovin' for me
We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

Give you all of me
Give you everything
Give you all of me I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
Why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)
And everyday I fall (everyday...)
It makes me wonder why (everyday...)
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'Cause every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

(Repeat...) Backwards, forwards but making no ground at all
Standing in the city with the clocks counting one
And your face is still wet from the fight before
As your tears hit the ground, blue flowers spring from them
Baby, I'm ashamed of the things I put you through
Baby, I'm ashamed of the man I was for you

And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"
And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"

How fast must we run before we can just take off in flight?
How far must we run before they do not recognise us?
So let's take this from the start, you'll be me and I'll be you
And let's try not to complain about your smoking
And my distant heart, and my distant heart
And my distant heart

And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"
And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"

(Too many mirrors in this house)
(And I don't like to see myself like this)
(I'm becoming the man I used to be, I guess)
(These walls could tell you a thing or two)
(Things that you really don't want to know)
(Lend me your eyes for your point of view)
(Lend me your feet and I'll stand by you)

And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do"
And all you said in your quietest voice
Was, "I needed you as much as they do" City headache subsides your dreary tone
Send a doctor to my house
Got me a fever coming round the bend
A heavy busload of danger

Straight talking you're sending me to bed
'Cause I ain't walking, in my state
A temperature that will not go away
So let it build up in my head

My head...

Prescribed pills just throw them down the sink
Cause in the hills is my cure.
No city headache to knock on my front door
No spewing faces to bug me.

Your output level brings thunder to my ears
A peaking signal from your mouth
Some cleansing water to wash away the grime of city laughter
Off my face.

My face...

It's not for me
The speed in which you walk
Would burn the soles of my feet.
Congested and choking from the fog
Of chain-smoking freak shows
That's how it goes so you just find the road
And pack your bags, for no more... Kid A, Kid A
Kid A, Kid A

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

Everything

Everything
In its right place

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything All...that I did was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face 
And I sat up straight

Oh, yeah yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

(I'm so unwanted)
No
I just don't understand why                      
You won't talk to me
It hurts
That I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me

I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away

I tried to belong
It didn't seem wrong
My head aches
It's been so long
I'll write this song
If that's what it takes 
Yeah

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You'd just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You'd just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away
Make me go away You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid, turned it blue

Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing and it's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?
How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

How dare you
How old are you now, anyway?

You're given a flower
But I guess that there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think that it's just me teasing you

You got a reaction
You got a reaction, didn't you?
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid, turned it blue

Get behind me
Get behind me now, anyway

Get behind me

You took a white orchid, turned it blue Johnny Walker sat at a table at the bar, minding his own affairs
Drinking his namesake over rocks, drunk, too drunk to care
When a girl in the bar walked up beside, and this is what she said
She said a woman came by with a letter for you and this is what the letter said

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read

Then John, he got up from the table, slowly he walked outside
He was thinking of his wife and little children back home
How his drinking had ruined their lives
Then John, he stared off into that streetlight
And the vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For it was him, lying drunk in that gutter
Clutching in his hand the letter that Johnny Walker read

Dear John, please Johnny, please come home
I need your love and the kids, they gotta be fed
And John, if you don't hurry back, I'll be gone
Yes, that's what the letter said
The letter that Johnny Walker read
